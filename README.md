## 🌿 What is CloverCatcher?

CloverCatcher is a **multimodal AI-powered vision app** that detects and highlights **four- and five-leaf clovers** in real-world imagery.

Born from folklore, built for the future — this app helps you **find luck without killing it**.

Why pluck a miracle just to watch it wither?

✨ It's better to **see the magic** than to **end it.**  
✨ It's better to **save a life** than to **prove a point.**  
✨ It's tech that doesn't just flex — it **respects**.

## 🍃 Why This Matters

In many cultures, the four-leaf clover is a **symbol of rare fortune**.  
The fifth? Even rarer — whispered in myth, a **sign of ancient blessings**.

But what happens every time someone picks one?  
They die.  
The "lucky" clover becomes a **dead souvenir**.

**CloverCatcher flips the script.**  
With computer vision and ethical design, we empower a world where:
- 🍀 Clovers are **seen**, not **snatched**.
- 🧠 AI can **honor nature**, not consume it.
- 🎯 Detection becomes **preservation**.
